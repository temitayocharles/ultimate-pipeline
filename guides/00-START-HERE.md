# Ultimate CI/CD Pipeline - Complete Setup Guide

**Welcome to the Ultimate CI/CD Pipeline Setup Guide**

This comprehensive guide will walk you through building a production-grade CI/CD infrastructure from scratch. Each step is carefully organized into separate documents to maintain clarity and focus.


---


## What You Will Build

A complete DevOps infrastructure including:

* Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment
* Kubernetes cluster with 1 master and 2 worker nodes
* SonarQube for code quality analysis
* Nexus repository for artifact management
* Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
* Automated deployment pipelines for Java applications


---


## Time Requirements

**First-time setup:** 2-3 hours

**After practice:** 45-60 minutes

**Cost per 4-hour session:** Approximately $0.67 (with infrastructure teardown)


---


## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure you have:

* AWS Account with administrative access
* Docker Hub Account (free tier)
* GitHub Account
* Terminal access (macOS, Linux, or WSL2 on Windows)
* Stable internet connection
* 2-3 hours of uninterrupted time

## Guide Structure

This guide is organized into 10 sequential steps. Each step must be completed before proceeding to the next.


### PHASE 1: Understanding and Preparation

**Step 1: Architecture Overview**
* Document: `01-architecture.md`
* Duration: 10 minutes
* Purpose: Understand system architecture and component relationships


**Step 2: AWS Account Setup**
* Document: `02-aws-setup.md`
* Duration: 15 minutes
* Tasks: SSH key creation, AWS CLI configuration, billing alerts


**Step 3: Local Environment Setup**
* Document: `03-local-setup.md`
* Duration: 10 minutes
* Tasks: Install Terraform, configure project files


---


### PHASE 2: Infrastructure Deployment

**Step 4: Terraform Deployment**
* Document: `04-terraform-deploy.md`
* Duration: 20 minutes
* Tasks: Initialize Terraform, deploy infrastructure, verify resources


---


### PHASE 3: Kubernetes Configuration

**Step 5: Kubernetes Initialization**
* Document: `05-kubernetes-setup.md`
* Duration: 20 minutes
* Tasks: Initialize master node, join workers, verify cluster


---


### PHASE 4: Service Configuration

**Step 6: Jenkins Configuration**
* Document: `06-jenkins-setup.md`
* Duration: 30 minutes
* Tasks: Initial login, plugin installation, tool configuration, credentials


**Step 7: SonarQube Configuration**
* Document: `07-sonarqube-setup.md`
* Duration: 10 minutes
* Tasks: Password setup, token creation, Jenkins integration


**Step 8: Nexus Configuration**
* Document: `08-nexus-setup.md`
* Duration: 10 minutes
* Tasks: Initial setup, repository configuration, credential management


---


### PHASE 5: Pipeline Deployment

**Step 9: CI/CD Pipeline Creation**
* Document: `09-pipeline-setup.md`
* Duration: 20 minutes
* Tasks: Create Jenkins job, configure Git integration, execute first build


**Step 10: Verification and Testing**
* Document: `10-verification.md`
* Duration: 15 minutes
* Tasks: Access application, test functionality, verify monitoring


---


## How to Use This Guide

### Best Practices

**Follow these guidelines for success:**

* Complete steps in sequential order
* Perform all verification checks before advancing
* Copy and paste commands exactly as written
* Read explanations to understand each action
* Document important outputs and credentials
* Save passwords and tokens securely


### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Do not:**

* Skip verification steps
* Jump to later sections prematurely
* Modify commands without understanding implications
* Close terminal sessions mid-process
* Neglect to save important configuration values

```
[ ] Step 1 - Architecture Overview
[ ] Step 2 - AWS Account Setup
[ ] Step 3 - Local Environment Setup
[ ] Step 4 - Terraform Deployment
[ ] Step 5 - Kubernetes Initialization
[ ] Step 6 - Jenkins Configuration
[ ] Step 7 - SonarQube Configuration
[ ] Step 8 - Nexus Configuration

## Troubleshooting Resources

If you encounter issues:

1. Review the troubleshooting section in each guide
2. Verify all prerequisite steps were completed
3. Check error messages for specific guidance
4. Consult the rollback procedures in each section


---


## Cost Management

**Important:** Running infrastructure costs approximately $0.27 per hour.

**To avoid ongoing charges after completion:**

```bash
cd terraform/
terraform destroy
```

Confirm with `yes` when prompted. This removes all AWS resources.

## Difficulty Assessment

| Step | Complexity | Reason |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1-3 | Beginner | Documentation and basic configuration |
| 4 | Intermediate | Terraform infrastructure deployment |
| 5 | Intermediate | Kubernetes cluster initialization |
| 6 | Advanced | Comprehensive Jenkins configuration |
| 7-8 | Intermediate | Service configuration |
| 9 | Intermediate | Pipeline creation and testing |
| 10 | Beginner | Verification procedures |
